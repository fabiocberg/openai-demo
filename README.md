# SNOMED and Artificial Intelligence demo

This demonstration showcases potential applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in the implementation of SNOMED CT. However, the use of AI in patient care requires careful planning, thorough validation, and consideration of potential ethical implications for all implementers. Therefore, it is important to assess the reliability, accuracy, and fairness of AI-powered solutions before deploying them in clinical settings, and to ensure that they comply with relevant regulations and guidelines.

This tool should not be used with real patient information or any identifiable data. The demo illustrates the use of OpenAI APIs, and all data entered in this demo will be submitted to <a href="https://openai.com/" target="_blank">OpenAI</a> for processing and is subject to their <a href="https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy" target="_blank"> privacy and data retention policies</a>.

This tools uses the ChatGPT API. The content generated by large language models, such as those used in ChatGPT, may not always be reliable or accurate. These models are trained on vast amounts of text data and use statistical patterns to generate responses, which can sometimes lead to errors, biases, or misinformation.

Therefore, it is important to use caution when relying on or interpreting the output of these models. You should always consider the source and context of the content, and verify any important information with reliable sources.
